# Background and Introduction

# Objective 1. Comprehensive Monitoring of Monarch Overwintering Sites
> Conduct a comprehensive monitoring of cluster locations, sizes, and microclimate conditions at selected overwintering sites. This will assist in understanding monarch occupancy, movement, mortality, and the factors that render a grove suitable for overwintering.

# Objective 2. Modeling Overwintering Grove Structure
> Develop modeling techniques to discern how the physical structure of overwintering groves correlates with wind protection and solar exposure. We're interested in leveraging various modeling approaches that have been proposed in the past by our partners and experts in the field. The use of geospatial datasets, hemispherical photography, LiDAR point cloud analysis, and field-based wind measurements could prove pivotal in formulating statistical associations between canopy structure and wind exposure.
