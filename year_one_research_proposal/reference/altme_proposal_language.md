# Task 1. Site selection and preliminary wind study
Review the existing sites on Vandenberg Space Force Base (VSFB) and select a suitable site for a pilot wind modeling study. The chosen site should have a significant population of overwintering monarch butterflies and be free from any study-interfering restrictions (e.g., military access and instrumentation). Existing LiDAR point cloud data will be requested from VSFB to support the study. Utilizing existing airport weather data, an analysis will be conducted to determine prevailing wind characteristics, including descriptions of wind events, typical conditions, and extreme wind events. Spatial analysis will be employed to prioritize sites with dynamic wind conditions. Terrain impact on instrument installation and design simplicity will also be evaluated, with preference given to relatively flat and accessible sites. Additionally, an on-site visit will be conducted in collaboration with monarch overwintering experts to assess potential groves.

## Deliverables:
• Detailed analysis of potential sites for the wind modeling study, including advantages and
disadvantages of each site, presented in a final report.
• Analysis of historical wind data at VSFB, including a set of model parameters for Task 2.
Findings will be presented in final report.

## Cost Estimate: 
$9,000

# Task 2. Conduct optimal sensor location study
In this task, an optimal sensor location study will be conducted at the selected site. Utilizing VSFB LiDAR data, the site will be digitally reconstructed, and various wind simulations will be performed under different conditions. Potential sensor locations will be identified to create a population of simulated wind speed values, considering all simulation conditions. The maximum entropy algorithm will be employed to design an optimized sensor layout,determining the necessary number of sensors for a comprehensive wind study.

## Deliverables
Section in final report detailing methods and findings of the optimal sensor location study. A specific plan for wind sensor locations within the selected study site at VSFB will be included.

## Cost Estimate
$12,000
