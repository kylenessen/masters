Today was very successful. We installed 9 sensors, bringing the total up to 11 within the grove. 

I'm writing these notes after the day and trying to pick up different thoughts. 

- The bucket/cherry picker worked really well for this type of work. The Bunyon Brothers were great to work with, and I would definitely just call them again if needed
- The modified Kiana setup worked really well. The only adjustment to the original plan was to use two straps at the base instead of one
- Having a two piece wratched strap worked well, especially for the upper anchor point. The hook allowed for us to put a loop of wire over the anchor
- For most of the instruments, we used some fairly standard dimensions. 
	- The length of cable was 15ft
	- the distance between the top anchor point and the bottom plate was 15ft
	- the length of the pole was 21ft
	- This allowed for a nice right right triangle that kept everything pretty compact
	- The setup up performed well in the wind
- If there was some need to adjust the hight after the points were established, you could simply shrink the pole to make the anchor point higher than the pole tip
- I tried to note when the instruments were deployed in my AC notes, but overall, I was inconsistent. I think it's better to just assume they are all good after 4 PM on October 11th.
- Having my hypsometer and laser pointer were ESSENTIAL. I am so glad I got both.
