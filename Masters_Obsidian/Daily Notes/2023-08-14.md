Intro and methods
Make sure that it's clear that I removed terrain as variable for wind modeling validation
Next level is to incorporate terrain

Don't use percent error because it scales with the magnitude of the wind speed
use buckets for wind speed
Continuous can always be categorical

Use a regression to test for model accuracy

What do the predicted values actually mean?
Is there a time component 

Actual measurements are wind speeds averaged over some interval (e.g. 1 min)
Predicted values need to be normalized to same average over the same interval
"temporal resolution"

Work on nomenclature for wind speeds in model and in measurement

Fine tuned predictions for wind measurement study
Actual vs predicted wind speeds should be closely correlated
While wind direction should increase in predictive power as wind speed increases

Pismo is complicated because it is mixed species grove
Threat of vandalism complicates

By the end of the day, 3 sites at vandenberg (not necessarily for my study)
Needs to be similar species (as much as possible)

- [ ]  Need to do upside down test
- [ ] Send numbers for 10 camera trap setups, including poles, cameras, and everything else

SOW suggestion:
Write for wind validation only
Include budget for poles that are 50ft
