Ronnie is hesitant to approve a bunch of wind monitoring equipment with moving parts

Potentially could use some of state parks ultrasonic sensors

These sensors have been used within monarch groves and no apparent response

Need to know where, how high, avoid access to public

- Schedule a meeting with Kyle to go over details of how to use the equipment

- Parks could help us install the sensors within the trees
- [x] Send Kiana paper to Stephanie

Tree work is happening in September (potentially)
Do hazardous tree work

- [x] Email Kyle about a call
