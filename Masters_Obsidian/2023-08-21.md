Need to redo the budget 
Buy equipment the first year
Then fund the next two years for time

USGS can do next year for my tuition

Can buy anything under 10,000 per vendor

240K over 3 years
me for a year

next fiscal year is October
tiny window until September to buy equipment
30K can be moved to year 2 for paying for time

Funds may be available 

Wind questions
- Does the grove provide protection
- and within the grove, are you getting site selection 

temperature is super important
humidity

time series for FLIR data
over the course of morning to afternoon
ideal conditions for aggregation and break up at the cluster level

Add in a burn question
Air quality sensors

Original proposal 
Two question:
Can we get an idea of grove structure and composition and how that relates to monarch abundance

Camp keep
hazard
San Simeon

How much air quality is affecting monarch grove quality
state parks looking for a null result

budget a year for me
- [ ] Find out about hiring undergrads through Francis

budget for 2 students at 275 hrs each 34 days of work
budget 25/hr for me >> 20K / 780 hours

up to 30K for equipment
main thing is 10K per vendor
- [ ] Get him the spreadsheet by the end of day tomorrow

Equipment needs to be ordered by September

Once they get money need to create agreement with university
All the money gets pushed into advisor

Have the fall tuition covered

Don't count on money coming in immediately October 1st
Can take time to get money

## Intellisense Systems
Looks like small, compact units that do it all. No idea on the cost. Have a request for quotes.

## HOBO
HOBO is expensive! Looks like I can build a 10 sensor (wind, temp, humidity) wireless setup for about 8900. Important to keep it under 10K per vendor.
