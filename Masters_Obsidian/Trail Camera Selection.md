# Trail Camera Selection Rationale

## Background
During the overwintering season, I plan to use a combination of trail cameras and wind data loggers to make repeated and high frequency observations of the monarch clusters. The goal here is to correlate presence/absence data of the clusters with wind conditions.

The image below shows a basic diagram of my proposed setup. Essentially a long pole will lift a camera and wind data logger to the same height as the monarchs. I will then use a modified trail camera that takes photos in near-infrared (NIR) to take photos at some interval (e.g. every 10 mins). The purpose of using NIR imagery is based off the observation that monarch clusters have high contrast in this wavelength compared to the vegetation that they are found in (Hirstov et. al. 2019).

## Modifying Camera Traps to NIR
Camera traps are ideal for this application because of a few key characteristics:
1. They are purpose built to withstand environmental conditions for extended periods of time.
2. Many have data logger features built in (timelapse mode).
3. Can be purchased to transmit photos over cellular networks.
4. Easily convertible to NIR. 

I want to focus on the last point in this section. All modern digital camera sensors can detect NIR light, a feature camera traps exploit. Within the camera module of these systems is small mechanical switch, that can move an IR cut filter in front or away from the lens. This allows the system to take normal color photos during the day (removing any NIR light), while still being able to use NIR LEDs to illuminate the scene at night (with the cut filter moved out of the way).

This is a big advantage, because the IR cut filter can be removed fairly easily. unlike most cameras which have the filter glued directly to the sensor. It can then be replaced with an "IR Pass" filter that, as it sounds, allows IR light to pass but not visible. 

Without going into too much detail, I was able to modify one my existing Camera Traps for this purpose. I used a Roscolux filter ( #382 "Congo Blue") as a make shift IR Pass filter, because of it's low vis and high NIR transmission (image below).

Camera traps utilize NIR light to illuminate their night scenes, taking advantage of this inherent property of imaging sensors. 

Which camera we purchase will be important to the success of this project. Below I outline the qualities I am looking for in these cameras, and various routes that can be taken. I also go through the options that I have researched so far.
