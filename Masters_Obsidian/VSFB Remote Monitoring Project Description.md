# Background
As part of my master's thesis I am investigating wind thresholds that monarch butterflies can tolerate during the overwintering period of their migration. I propose to utilize game cameras mounted on 50ft telescoping poles to capture high-frequency observations at the height of butterfly clusters during winter storm events. Various abiotic factors, such as wind speed and direction, will be measured concurrently. The aim of this study to elucidate the conditions at which monarchs will abandon a cluster site. These findings will directly inform conservation efforts by providing biologically relevant thresholds for restoration planning. In particular, these thresholds will be used to interpret the results of wind simulations in monarch groves, a methodology being developed concurrently. This research is especially timely given the imminent listing of the monarch butterfly under the Endangered Species Act, heightening the urgency to better understand how to manage monarch habitat.
# Study Locations
We propose to deploy equipment at thirteen known monarch overwintering site in Vandenberg Space Force Base. These sites were selected in collaboration with base personnel because they are:
- Accessible
- Not in proximity to areas of high visitation
- Have at least some monarchs for at least part of the season.  
See figure below for an overview for the site locations.
![[Sites Overview.pdf]]

There are seven (7) sites located on North Base, and five (5) sites located on South Base. Please see figures below for proposed study boundaries for each site.

# Instrumentation Configuration
The primary data collection equipment will be composed of a commercially available trail camera (GardePro E Series) and a wind data logger (RainWise WindLog). Additional specifications for each measuring instrument is provided in the following sections.
The equipment will be lifted to the height of overwintering monarch via a fiberglass telescoping pole. The maximum height of the pole is 50 ft, and will be secured through the use of dacron guy lines. Ground anchors (Orange Screwâ„¢) will be used to secure the ground guy lines to the telescoping pole. The maximum depth required by the ground anchors is eight inches. No additional supports are needed, with up to nine (9) ground anchors being used for a given pole. Please see figure below for a visual diagram of the data collection instrumentation.

## Equipment Specifications
Below are further details on the two main instruments in this study. We propose to use up to twenty five (25) camera poles at any given time.
### GardePro Trail Cameras
Either GardePro E8 (20 total) or GardePro E7 (5 total) trail cameras are proposed to be used in this study. These cameras are wifi and bluetooth enabled, allowing for a live preview of what the camera sees. This feature is especially important for this study, because it will allow us to ensure monarchs are in frame while the camera is high up on the pole. The only data that can be transferred from these cameras is local to any device connected to the camera hotspot. 

**Please note**, the maximum effective wifi range of these cameras is 40ft, less than the maximum height of the pole. Antennae will be positioned to maximize reception along the vertical axis, minimizing connectivity as you move away from the poles. Additionally, all frequency emitting features (wifi, bluetooth) can be disabled and antennae removed.

### RainWise WindLog
To capture wind speed, we will use RainWise WindLog instruments. These devices do not have any frequency emitting equipment onboard, and simply record measurements to onboard storage. Data recovery must be done in person via USB cable.
