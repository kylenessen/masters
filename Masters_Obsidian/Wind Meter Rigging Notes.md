- Need to rethink how the pivot joint is attached to the tree. Right now it is dependent on metal cable which may or may not be fine. I'd prefer to use tie down traps, which will require the pivot joints to be modified so they can feed the straps through the back
- Need to find a solution to the lock box at a lower point. Perhaps use a metal leader to prevent tampering
- I didn't do everything from the ladder, and that would perhaps be good to try out. 
- I liked setting the highest point first
- The tie down straps worked really well. They have a built in weight at the end for whipping the strap around the tree. The also have a loop which is a nice secure anchor point for the drop line
- Need to create a calculator, or some kind ideal setup for the spacing of all the components 
- It's worth double checking all the instruments to see if cord can be pushed through evenly.
