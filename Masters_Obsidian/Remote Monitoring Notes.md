Spent some time today thinking through how to use cameras to remotely monitor monarch clusters. 

I came up with this design, which I illustrated using Rhino. The file can be found on my Althouse and Meade OneDrive, but should probably be moved to the github.

Basic idea here is to be able to mast up the modified camera and wind logger to get close to the butterflies. In my illustration, I have it on a tripod, but after a bunch of research, I'm now thinking I should use guy lines and a masting pole. 

Here are some videos that influenced my thinking:

I particularly like this guy's setup, where uses guy lines to keep the pole in place:

For ground anchors, I found these:

They look strong, and can be used with power tools, which will be a big help in the field. There are many like this, so worth exploring a bit. 

For the masting pole, I explored widely, but found this 50ft pole that has really thought through the problem:

 

It's not cheap, but there should be budget. Also having the extra height should be very useful, as monarchs can easily be above 30ft. 

All necessary accessories are offered on the site, and they offer bulk discounts. I'm thinking I order 10 and call it a day. 

I spent some time with chatGPT to elvauate how to guy the mast. Here are the summary points:
1. **Guy Line Angle & Stability**:
    
    - A steeper angle (closer to the ground) for guy lines provides more lateral stability, especially in high winds.
    - We focused on a 30° angle for the guy lines for optimal resistance to wind while balancing downward force.
2. **Guy Line Configuration**:
    
    - Both triangular (3 guy lines) and square (4 guy lines) configurations were discussed.
    - An offset configuration was proposed, with the top guy lines aligned with prevailing winds and the bottom set rotated to cover six directions for enhanced stability.
3. **Pole Height vs. Anchor Distance**:
    
    - Using a 30° angle, a chart was generated to show the relationship between pole height and the distance from the pole base to the anchor point.
    - For example, a 50ft pole requires the guy lines to be anchored about 28.87ft from the base.
4. **Rope Strength Estimation**:
    
    - The estimated tension in the guy line due to wind loads of 30 mph was approximately 2643.95 N2643.95N or around 265 kgf (after applying a safety factor of 2).
    - We discussed a 4mm rope with a rating of 330 kgf, which exceeds the estimated tension requirement and should be suitable.
5. **Terms & Definitions**:
    
    - Break Load (Breaking Strength): Maximum force the cord can withstand before breaking.
    - Working Strength (Safe Working Load): A fraction of the break load, providing a safety margin for regular use.
6. **Pole Considerations**:
    
    - The material, diameter, height, weight, and base stability of the pole itself are crucial factors to consider for overall system stability.

From the website, they recommend dacron, which is resistant to stretching. I think I can buy all the guying accessories from the site and have just one order purchase.
