# Background
In my consulting work, I have developed wind modeling methods to gain more insight into how current monarch overwintering groves function in their wind protection, and how proposed actions may change those wind conditions. While these methods appear to work for relative measures, they have not been validated with real world observations. 

The study outlined below is my current thinking on how to go about a validation exercise of wind simulations in monarch groves.
# Study Site
Pismo Monarch Grove presents an exciting study site for several reasons:
1. Pismo is a reliable site that routinely ranks among the largest in any overwintering period
2. Existing monitoring efforts will complement this study and vice versa
3.  The site sits in a topographical "simple" context, with few nearby confounding terrain features such as hillsides or deep valleys
4. Pismo Monarch Grove is a popular attraction where the public can have an excellent introduction to the monarch migration story, warranting prioritization for conservation efforts that this study may facilitate 

However, because of the grove's popularity and uncommon public access there are several constraints that this study must design around:

1.
