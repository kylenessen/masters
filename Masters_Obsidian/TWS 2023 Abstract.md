- Monarch butterflies seek specific microclimate conditions when overwintering in the groves along the california coast
- Protection from strong wind events is hypothesized to be an important factor in suitable overwintering habitat, but few studies have investigated this directly
- With the imminent listing the monarch butterfly under the endangered species act, it is more important than ever to better understand what are the critical wind thresholds that monarch will tolerate in their overwintering behavior so that better management recommendations and actions can be made to enhance overwintering sites
- In this talk, I will outline one of my master's projects which attempts to answer the question direcly of how much wind can monarchs tolerate
- Using modified game cameras, repeated an high frequency observations of the monarchs will be made at the height of the cluster
- This will be done using 50ft telescoping poles and will allow measurements at the site of the clusters
- Abiotic measures, such as wind speed, direction, temperature, humidity, and light will be recorded as well
- Using citizen science platforms, the imagery will be used to estimate cluster size and behavior
- The end result will be the probability of cluster dissolution at various wind speeds
- This information will be invaluable to make better recommendations and will complement additional work, such as wind simulations within monarch groves

  
In this talk, I will introduce my master's project that aims to investigate the critical wind thresholds that monarch butterflies can endure during their overwintering in the groves along the California coast. This research is especially timely given the imminent listing of the monarch butterfly under the Endangered Species Act. Utilizing modified game cameras mounted on 50ft telescoping poles, we will capture high-frequency observations at the height of butterfly clusters. Various abiotic factors such as wind speed, direction, temperature, humidity, and light will be measured concurrently. Citizen science platforms will assist in analyzing the imagery to estimate cluster size and behavior. Although the study is currently in the data collection stage, it aims to determine the probability of cluster dissolution under varying wind conditions. The findings are intended to inform and improve conservation efforts, and they will complement other ongoing work like wind simulations within monarch groves.

The overwintering groves of monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) have long been an enigmatic spectacle and a subject of scientific inquiry. The conditions within these groves are believed to be pivotal for the survival and subsequent migration of this iconic species. While temperature and humidity have been extensively studied, the effects of wind within these groves remain poorly understood. This paper presents a multi-faceted methodology designed to investigate the impact of wind conditions on the behavior, physiology, and overall well-being of monarch butterflies in their overwintering habitats. Utilizing a combination of in-situ weather stations, high-resolution computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, and micro-sensor tagging techniques on the butterflies, we aim to create a detailed spatiotemporal map of wind patterns and their direct effects on the monarch population. The proposed methods are intended to offer insights that could be crucial for conservation strategies, particularly in the wake of increasing climatic unpredictabilities. Preliminary results suggest that wind speeds and directions significantly affect the butterflies' clustering behavior, energy expenditure, and, consequently, their overwintering success. This research not only fills a vital gap in the existing literature but also introduces a novel approach to studying microclimates and animal behavior in a complex natural setting.
