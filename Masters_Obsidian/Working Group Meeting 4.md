# Agenda
- Review [[VSFB Remote Monitoring Project Description]]
- Discuss [[Wind Meter Rigging Notes]]
	- Do we need a bucket?
	- Can I use ladders

## Peter updates
- Will bring gear down from Mariposa if govt doesn't shut down

## Wind Study
- Verbal OK from Xerces to pay for bucket lift
- Need to make sure we are paying prevailing wage
- Probably will go the 
- Try to get the work done before the butterflies arrive
- Latest would be first week of October (maybe second week)
- Contingent on whether or not they are available

- [ ] Write a short paragraph about what the bucket arborists will do for contracting people at Xerces
- Plan for checking the sensors more frequently early on to make sure they are working as expected


## Remote Monitoring 
- USFWS is asking to monitoring spring canyon monarchs before and after rocket launches
	- Could help fulfill requirements
	- Tried cameras before, but launch the knocked out the cameras
	- Also asking to weather monitoring 
	- VSFB staff are unaware of any successful recording of monarch behavior during a launch
	  [ ] Look into any effects of rocket launches on electronics
- [ ] What is the cost of the project 
	- Equipment
	- time 
	- mileage, etc
	- nearest 5K or 10K
	- Ultimately no cost to vandenberg
- Some equipment is already here
- [ ] Order IR pass filters
- [ ] Need signage


## CASC 
- PM2.5 sensors pulling about a watt
- can run 2-3 days 
- FLIR C5
