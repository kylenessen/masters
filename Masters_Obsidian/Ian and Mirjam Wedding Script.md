If you are in love — that’s a good thing — that’s about the best thing that can happen to anyone.

Love is an outpouring of everything good in you — of kindness and consideration and respect — not only the social respect of manners but the greater respect which is recognition of another person as unique and valuable.

If it is right, it happens - The main thing is not to hurry, as nothing good gets away.
