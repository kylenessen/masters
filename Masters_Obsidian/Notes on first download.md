ZenGlobe only had 12% of it's total memory used
battery is at 4.2 V, the lowest I've seen
Most were at 4.4. I believe max is 4.7
ZenGlobe is also quite problematic as a sensor, giving gusts over 200 m/s 
Should replace this sensor.


For start and end times, consider using a track and then exculde any measurements during the download period

Also consider labeling locks and keys so it's easier to figure out which goes with which
