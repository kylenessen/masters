![[wind meter dimensions]]

Above I have copied a diagram of all the relevant measures I can think of regarding the installation of wind meters along two points on the trunk of a tree. 

# Angle of pole
There are two competing principles at play here when deciding the angle of the pole: 
1. **Stability**: The smaller the angle (more vertical), the more stable the pole will be. This minimizes $b$. 
2. **Interference:** The closer the instruments are to the trunk, the more that object will interfere with the wind measurements. It's best to have the wind meter 10x the distance from the diameter of the trunk, but for this application, it may not be possible. 

# Constraints
Let's make this easier on ourselves and define some constraints:
1. $a$ = 28ft
2. $f$ = 15ft 
3. $Î¸$ can vary
4. $c$ can vary
5.
