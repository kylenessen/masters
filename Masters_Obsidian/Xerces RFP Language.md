**Proposal Title**:  Evaluating Wind Patterns in Overwintering Groves for Improved Monarch Conservation

**Project Description:** 
The Xerces Society is keenly interested in advancing research that will provide critical insights into the management of overwintering sites on Department of Defense lands. As part of our efforts, we are launching a pilot study at Vandenberg Space Force Base and other sites on CA State Parks lands from the Fall of 2023 to the Winter of 2024.

The primary objectives of this research project are:
1. Conduct a comprehensive monitoring of cluster locations, sizes, and microclimate conditions at selected overwintering sites. This will assist in understanding monarch occupancy, movement, mortality, and the factors that render a grove suitable for overwintering.
2. Develop modeling techniques to discern how the physical structure of overwintering groves correlates with wind protection and solar exposure. We're interested in leveraging various modeling approaches that have been proposed in the past by our partners and experts in the field. The use of geospatial datasets, hemispherical photography, LiDAR point cloud analysis, and field-based wind measurements could prove pivotal in formulating statistical associations between canopy structure and wind exposure.

The outcome of this endeavor will play a pivotal role in informing site-specific management plans, not just on the DoD lands but also areas managed by other entities, including the California State Parks and U.S. Forest Service.

**Proposal Requirements:** 
- The proposal should focus on building a model for winds in overwintering groves and validating the results using actual wind measurements.
- Proof of concept within a single grove would be considered satisfactory.
- Further expansion or application of the proposed approach/protocol would be subject to additional funding.
