# Validating Wind Modeling Methods in Monarch Overwintering Groves
## RFP Language
![[Xerces RFP Language]]
## Background and Introduction
- The multi-generational journey of monarch butterflies is one of the most famous examples of migration in the animal kingdom (National Geographic Society 2022)
- Every year, monarch butterflies in western North America travel up to thousands of miles from their summer breeding grounds to gather in dense clusters along the California coast.
- Critical to the success of monarch migration, is the availability and suitability of overwintering groves along coastal California. 
- Forest structure is thought to provide suitable habitat by creating a microclimate that has favorable temperature, humidity, light availability, and wind protection.
